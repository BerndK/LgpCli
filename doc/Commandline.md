If you need to provide a policy, the commandline expects an identifier like `windows.ExplorerRibbonStartsMinimized`. This a category and the internal name of the policy. The categoty is not exactly the name in the tree, but quite similar. The name is the internal ID, defined in the admx-files. The app usually marks these idents in yellow (like <span style="color:yellow;">windows.ExplorerRibbonStartsMinimized</span>). The app always shows this ID, so it won't be a problem to find it.

When specifying policy, you also need to provide the scope ('class') **machine** or the **user** configuration. So the class of a policy can be machine or user. (class is usually marked as light blue in LgpCli like <span style="color:skyblue;">machine</span>)

When LgpCli reports the state of a policy, there might be the value <span style="color:red;">suspect</span>. This is not necessarily an error. This just is an indicator, that not all values of the policy have an expected state. Sometimes multiple policies are setting overlapping different values. So don't be scary here. You can also check the current state using GpEdit.msc<br>
NOTE:<br>
GPEdit does not show changed values instantly. You need to **RESTART** GPEdit to see changed policies values.
## `LgpCli interactive /?`
```
Description:
  Shows the commandline UI.

Usage:
  LgpCli interactive [command] [options]

Commands:
  show <policy> <Both|Machine|User>  Shows a policy.
```  
There is currently only one command available in this section:
### `LgpCli interactive show /?`
This will start the interactive mode and directly jump to a policy. Was just useful for testing.
```
Description:
  Shows a policy.

Usage:
  LgpCli interactive show [<policy> [<policyclass>]] [options]

Arguments:
  <policy>             Prefixed name of a policy.
  <Both|Machine|User>  Context for a policy.

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information
```

## `LgpCli enable /?`
enables a single policy
```
Description:
  sets a policy to enabled/active state

Usage:
  LgpCli enable [<policy> [<policyclass>]] [options]

Arguments:
  <policy>             Prefixed name of a policy.
  <Both|Machine|User>  Context for a policy.

Options:
  -k, --key <key>                            name for an element value for setting a policy.
  -v, --value <value>                        value for an element value for setting a policy.
  -gs, --get-state <After|Before|Both|None>  reports also the state before or after setting it [default: Both]
  -?, -h, --help                             Show help and usage information
```
if the policy has values to define, you need to specify them as pairs of key and value. The key is shown in the policy (typical in blue like <span style="color:blue;">ExplorerRibbonStartsMinimizedDropdown</span>)<br>
Example:<br>
`LgpCli enable windows.ExplorerRibbonStartsMinimized User -k ExplorerRibbonStartsMinimizedDropdown -v ExplorerRibbonStartsMinimized_StartsNotMinimized`<br>
There might be multiple pairs if the policy takes more than one value. In special cases, there are also multiple values allowed (list values).<br>
Don't bother with that syntax, just use the option 'B' in the policy-view to build the syntax for the current policy. Use 'M' to modify the values according to your needs first (go back with 'Esc').<br>
You can check the state before and after applying the policy, use `-gs both` which is the default, use 'none' to skip these checks.

NOTE:<br>
GPEdit does not show changed values instantly. You need to **RESTART** GPEdit to see changed policy states/values in GPEdit.
